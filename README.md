# Cryptography Concepts
**Objective**: Demonstrates cryptographic principles with a focus on steganography and integrity verification.

## Tools Used
- **Steghide** and **SteGUI**: Tools for embedding hidden data in files.
- **SHA-1 Hashing**: Used for file integrity checks.

## Key Concepts
- **Steganography**: Hiding data within images or audio files for secure storage.
- **Data Integrity**: Verifying file authenticity through hash comparison.

## Lab Overview
1. **Data Hiding**: Embedded secret data in an image using Steghide and verified with SHA-1.
2. **File Manipulation**: Used Linux commands (`ls`, `cat`) to confirm file modifications.

## Learnings
- Practical experience in cryptography using steganography and integrity validation techniques.
- Gained insight into the importance of securing data.
